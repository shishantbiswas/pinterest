# Pinterest Clone

hey there, this is a pinterest clone I build with NextJs, tailwindcss and shadcn/ui. You can upload images just like in pinterest share them, the basic pinterest stuff I'm still intrested in adding more features like saving to a list, or like a post and such but I'm too lazy to do that rn

# self-host

there not really much needed if you're intrested in self-hosting, you'll need Pocketbase which if you plan to use docker I have a Dockerfile you'll be able to use then in the .env.example file put your actual Pocketbase URL and you're done
